Simple javascripts that probably can be written in shorter lines

These are actually my first ever javascripts files I have ever written, and the noobiness probably shows.
As you can see, there are two javascript files, <b>NightNDay4chan.user.js</b> and <b>RedditLinksNUpvotes.user.js</b>.

<b>The 4chan one</b> is tied to the setup I have going for 4chan, but if you get the files below, it may work for you, too,
if you tweak the code:

- OneeChan 
- 4chanX (ccd0)

<b>The reddit one</b> should work for everyone. What it basically does is work on these two keybinds: 

- SHIFT + u: Upvotes all links on a reddit link page (not a comment thread yet) and opens links in new tabs

- SHIFT + i: Just upvotes all links on a reddit link page

As of June 15th, 2016, the function that handles new tabs works flawlessly. Code was kindly used from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11389138">here.</a> <i><b>A word of caution:</b> If you are on Chrome 41+, it may not work for you, but as on my current build that is <b>44.0.2403.39 (Official Build) beta-m (64-bit),</b> I haven't had any issues yet. <b>ALSO, </b> this script probably won't work for Firefox when trying to open links. If you do either of the keybinds, you will probably just see the script upvote the posts.</i>

The main purpose was to automatically upvote and open links 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sn1pe/m/nsfwheaven">on my <b>NSFW</b> multireddit</a> so I could show my appreciation and search
for the ultimate sauce of the content posted. 

Since this script was motivated by NSFW content, part of me wants to add in a function to it that goes a step further by searching 
for the sauce for me. Not sure how I'll go about displaying/saving the sauce info, but...I'll find a way ;)
