Simple javascripts that probably can be written in shorter lines

These are actually my first ever javascripts files I have ever written, and the noobiness probably shows.
As you can see, there are three javascript files, <b>NightNDay4chan.user.js</b>, <b>RedditLinksNUpvotes.user.js</b><b>, </b> and <b>googleImagesDL.user.js</b>.

<b>The 4chan one</b> is tied to the setup I have going for 4chan, but if you get the files below, it may work for you, too,
if you tweak the code:

- OneeChan 
- 4chanX (ccd0)

<b>The reddit one</b> should work for everyone. What it basically does is work on these two keybinds: 

- SHIFT + u: Upvotes all links on a reddit link page (not a comment thread yet) and opens links in new tabs

- SHIFT + i: Just upvotes all links on a reddit link page

<b>The Google one</b> is totally new and so far probaly only works in Firefox. All you have to do to use it is to press SHIFT + i and all the images on the page should download. I have a feeling this description will change drastically.

For the 4chan and reddit ones, Chrome and Firefox should work with them.

The main purpose was to automatically upvote and open links 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sn1pe/m/nsfwheaven">on my <b>NSFW</b> multireddit</a> so I could show my appreciation and search
for the ultimate sauce of the content posted. 

Since this script was motivated by NSFW content, part of me wants to add in a function to it that goes a step further by searching 
for the sauce for me. Not sure how I'll go about displaying/saving the sauce info, but...I'll find a way ;)
