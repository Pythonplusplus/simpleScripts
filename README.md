Simple javascripts that probably can be written in shorter lines

These are actually my first ever javascripts files I have ever written, and the noobiness probably shows.
As you can see, there are two javascript files, <b>NightNDay4chan.user.js</b> and <b>RedditLinksNUpvotes.user.js</b>.

<b>The 4chan one</b> is tied to the setup I have going for 4chan, but if you get the files below, it may work for you, too,
if you tweak the code:

- OneeChan 
- 4chanX (ccd0)

<b>The reddit one</b> should work for everyone. What it basically does is work on these two keybinds: 

- SHIFT + u: Upvotes all links on a reddit link page (not a comment thread yet) and opens links in new tabs

- SHIFT + i: Just upvotes all links on a reddit link page

As of August 1st, making script only work in Firefox mainly since I'm probably the only one using it.

The main purpose was to automatically upvote and open links 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sn1pe/m/nsfwheaven">on my <b>NSFW</b> multireddit</a> so I could show my appreciation and search
for the ultimate sauce of the content posted. 

Since this script was motivated by NSFW content, part of me wants to add in a function to it that goes a step further by searching 
for the sauce for me. Not sure how I'll go about displaying/saving the sauce info, but...I'll find a way ;)
